<p>As the emerge of LOD, more and more heterogeneous data sets are being integrated, which calls for potential users to use a complex query language, e.g., SPARQL, for search on the data sets. However, as SPARQL is not easy to write even for experienced users, many groups are developing assistive methods, e.g., visual SPARQL editor.</p>

<p>In the LODQA project, we focus on natural language as a human-friendly representational mean of search queries. It would be obviously convenient if search queries espressed in natural language can be converted to SPARQL queries. Together with speech recognition system, it would be even more powerful in the era of mobile computing. We can also think about a harmonic use with other assistive SPARQL authoring methods: a SPARQL may be drafted using a natural language query processing system, then precisely revised using a visual editor.</p>
<p>With extensive potential in mind, LODQA focuses on developing a natural language query procedding system as an open source project.</p>
